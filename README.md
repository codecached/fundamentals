# AI Matchmaking Simulation

Welcome to the AI Matchmaking Simulation project! This repository contains an interactive Jupyter Notebook that explores how AI uses personality traits, sensitivity, specificity, and thresholds to simulate dating match predictions. It combines storytelling, data science, and visualization to explain these concepts in an engaging and accessible way.

## Project Overview

In this notebook, we simulate a dating scenario with 30 boys and 30 girls, each having traits like **humor**, **kindness**, and **adventure** scored from 0 to 10. Using these, we:

- Calculate **compatibility scores** for all possible pairs based on how similar their traits are.
- Use **AI predictions** with noise to model imperfect real-world matchmaking.
- Examine how adjusting the **threshold** changes the number and quality of matches.
- Explore **sensitivity** (catching true matches) and **specificity** (avoiding bad matches).
- Visualize results with plots like sensitivity-specificity curves and ROC curves.
- Highlight "Matches Made in Heaven" with names for the top AI-predicted pairs.

The notebook narrates the entire process using chapters and explanations — including a layman-friendly section describing how these concepts relate to real dating.

## Features

- Personality Trait Simulation for boys and girls
- Compatibility score calculation using similarity weighted by trait importance
- AI prediction simulation with added noise to mimic real uncertainty
- Threshold tuning to balance sensitivity and specificity
- Confusion matrix computation for match evaluation
- Visualizations:
  - Sensitivity and specificity vs. threshold
  - ROC curve for AI matchmaking performance
  - Interactive plot of top predicted matches with names
- Storytelling style with chapters and markdown explanations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - plotly

You can install required packages via pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn plotly
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-matchmaking-simulation.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd ai-matchmaking-simulation
```

3. Open the notebook:

```
jupyter notebook ai_matchmaking_simulation.ipynb
```

4. Follow the cells in order. The notebook is fully annotated with explanations and visuals.

## How It Works — In Brief

- **Compatibility Score:** Measures closeness of personality traits weighted by importance.
- **AI Prediction:** Adds noise to simulate imperfect matchmaking guesses.
- **Threshold:** Decides how confident the AI must be to call a match.
- **Sensitivity & Specificity:** Metrics for true matches found versus mismatches avoided.
- **ROC Curve:** Shows trade-off across all threshold choices.
- **Matches Made in Heaven:** Lists couples with the highest AI predicted match probabilities.
